# JavaScript Modules Exercise

## Overview

This exercise involves splitting an existing JavaScript file into modules and classes to promote better code organisation and reuse.

You will start with a single JavaScript file and refactor it into 2 modules and one class.

## Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
```

### 2. Review the Existing Code

Open the scripts.js file located in the assets/js directory and review the existing code.

### 3. Create New Modules

Split the code into at least two modules and one class.

**Example Structure:**

- eventHandlers.js: This module will contain functions that handle button events.
- domManipulation.js: This module will contain functions that manipulate the DOM.
- post.js: This module will define a Post class.

/assets
/js - domManipulation.js - eventHandlers.js - post.js- scripts.js

- index.html
- README.md

### 4. Refactor scripts.js

Refactor the scripts.js to use the new modules.

### 5. Implement the Modules

Create the following files in the assets/js directory:

### 6. Test Your Changes

Open index.html in a web browser to ensure everything works as expected.

### 7. Commit and Push Your Changes

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Refactored JavaScript into modules and added Post class"
git push origin main
```
